# MotoCenter
This is a Java Spring Boot based Web Application composed of e-commerce, chat and other features. The main goal was to make place for selling, buying and having chat with seller, regarding motorcycles. Starting with login page I decided to make every feature only by myself, only from my ideas and my point of view, so I could learn as much as possible. It is hard to remember how many issues I had to face, but for sure I learned how to work independently and solve problems.<br><br>
